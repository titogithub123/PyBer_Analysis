# PyBer Ride Sharing Data Analysis: "Urban, Suburban and Rural".
## Ride Sharing Statistical Summary -
### "What We Can Learn about the Frequency and Econmic Output of Multiple City Types"
### Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose for this analysis is to calculate and compute local fare and driver averages of PyBer Ride Sharing drivers in distinct city types. As a new member of the PyBer data science team it has come to my desk to make a last minute change to the Analysis our team is expected to present. In this new and updated analysis, the CEO of the company, V. Isualize has asked us to calculate and prepare a dataframe that summarizes the averages for the diffent city types. In order to that we must determine the following information ***(Per City Type)***.

- Total Number of Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver.

### Results of the Analysis
After deploying our python and pandas skills on the new assignment that V. Isualize assigned to our team we were able to calculate the following results, encapuslating them into a comprehensive DataFrame that makes it easy to see at a glance the data we used and the averages of the business that the CEO had asked for.

As you can see from the image above there are more rides provided and more drivers available in the urban landscape then the in the other two options however, the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver are lower than both the suburban and rural areas. In the same breath, the Average Fare per Ride is higher in both the suburban and rural settings and the Average Fare per Driver in rural areas is more than three times the Average Fare per Driver than in the urban areas.

V. Isualize also wanted us to make a bar graph to get a visual representation of the Total Fares for Each Week by City Type. You can see our graph below.
