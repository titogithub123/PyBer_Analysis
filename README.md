# PyBer Ride Sharing Data Analysis: "Urban, Suburban and Rural".
## Ride Sharing Statistical Summary -
### "What We Can Learn about the Frequency and Econmic Output of Multiple City Types"
### Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose for this analysis is to calculate and compute local fare and driver averages of PyBer Ride Sharing drivers in distinct city types. As a new member of the PyBer data science team it has come to my desk to make a last minute change to the Analysis our team is expected to present. In this new and updated analysis, the CEO of the company, V. Isualize has asked us to calculate and prepare a dataframe that summarizes the averages for the diffent city types. In order to that we must determine the following information ***(Per City Type)***.

- Total Number of Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver.

### Results of the Analysis
After deploying our python and pandas skills on the new assignment that V. Isualize assigned to our team we were able to calculate the following results, encapuslating them into a comprehensive DataFrame that makes it easy to see at a glance the data we used and the averages of the business that the CEO had asked for.

As you can see from the image above there are more rides provided and more drivers available in the urban landscape then the in the other two options however, the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver are lower than both the suburban and rural areas. In the same breath, the Average Fare per Ride is higher in both the suburban and rural settings and the Average Fare per Driver in rural areas is more than three times the Average Fare per Driver than in the urban areas.

 #### Total Fares by City Type

Additionaly, V. Isualize also wanted us to make a bar graph to get a visual representation of the Total Fares for Each Week by City Type. You can see our graph in the image above. As is made evident by our graph the highest number of weekly totals is in the urban section of town. This should come as no surprise as there are more people concentrated in the urban centers than in suburban or rural areas

In this case our graph is somewhat limited in that we end the plotting of the data on April 29th, so we are not able to see the total weekly amounts for the rest of the year. However, we can make an argument from what we've already seen that it is most likely that the trajectory of the Total Fares for Each Week should continue in a similar fashion as to how they are currently represented. 

### Summary
Having worked on our data for quite a while our team became intimatly familiar with it's contents and as such we were able to extract three business recomendations that we can make to our boss, V. Isulaize and the other stake holders. We would now like to present those recomendations.

1. Taking a look at our Average Fare per Driver in rural areas we see that the total average fare amount per driver is more than 3 times the average fare amount per driver in the urban areas. We have an average of $55.49 in the rural areas and an average of $16.57 in the urban areas. Taking this information into account we can suggest a marketing campaign to entice more drivers to focus on rural areas. While this would decreese the average amount each driver would make per trip it could potentially raise total revenue if more drivers were avaiable in this area.

2. Simialrly, it looks like the suburban areas are also prime candiates to attract more drivers as there is still room to grow in this segment. While trips in suburban areas might not take as long as trips in rural areas by increasing the number of drivers available you may be able to service more demand by having a larger supply of drivers on hand, especially during peak times.

3. To make the most out of the fierce competition we find in the urban centers, I would actually suggest further investigation into the data so we can find the peak times of service used and the peak areas of the urban landscape where most rides originate from and once this information was in hand we can prioritize driver scheduling to be at the places riders start their journey at the times most riders are looking for rides. This way we would capitalize on the peak busy hours of the day, thereby allowing the company to maximize revenue.
